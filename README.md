# HeaderFs
A Header based FileSystem
# Features
- a simple but functional FileSystem
- isn't compatible with the other filesystems

## THINGS TO ADD IN 1 HUNDRED YEARS (i'm joking probably only 2 or 5 years)
-anything to be compatible with ext4 and Fat filesystems

## OTHER THINGS..............
-this filesystem is in my OS but it isn't as HeaderFs, it is part of the kernel
